Session summary (2026-02-05):
- Completed Feature 001: chess.com bullet pipeline end-to-end.
- Evidence: screenshot at verification/feature-001-chesscom-bullet-pipeline-2026-02-04.png.
- Evidence: test scripts at verification/puppeteer_feature_001_chesscom_bullet_pipeline.js and verification/integration_feature_001_chesscom_bullet_pipeline.js.
- Tests run: manual UI walkthrough (screenshot) + integration script.
- Current pass count: 1/100.
- Next action: Feature 2 (lichess blitz pipeline).

Next steps:
- Implement and verify the lichess blitz end-to-end pipeline feature.
- Expand UI coverage for pipeline summaries and practice queue.
- Continue adding MVP data validation tests for canonical scenarios.

Session summary (2026-02-04):
- Read app-spec.txt and created feature_list.json with 100 prioritized MVP test cases.
- Added root README.md with project overview and quick start notes.
- Initialized MVP structure placeholders in src/tactix (domain, ports, app/use_cases, infra/clients, infra/db).

Session summary (2026-02-05):
- Raised Python test coverage to >=95% and refactored high-complexity functions to satisfy xenon.
- Added regression tests for small modules and rating bucket SQL clauses.
- Cleaned lint/type/vulture issues introduced during refactors.
- Ran make check (pytest, vitest, xenon, pycycle, safety, bandit, dodgy, jscpd, vulture, knip, cargo build, client build).

Session summary (2026-02-04):
- Fixed lint failures (E501, PLR0913) in PGN upsert helpers with small refactors.

Session summary (2026-02-04):
- Refactored duplicated analysis context accessors into `_AnalysisRunAccessors`.
- Refactored no-games context initialization and window accessors into shared helpers/mixin.
- Before→After map:
	- AnalysisRunContext/AnalysisAndMetricsContext properties → `_AnalysisRunAccessors` mixin.
	- NoGames* context window/games validation + accessors → `_resolve_no_games_window_from_kwargs`, `_require_no_games_payload_games`, `_NoGamesWindowAccessors`.

Session summary (2026-02-04):
- Consolidated 33 pipeline helper modules into `app/use_cases/pipeline_support.py` with object-backed helpers.
- Migrated pipeline call sites to `PipelineCoercions`, `PipelineProfileFilters`, `PipelineEmissions`, `PipelineNoGames`, `PipelineAnalysisCheckpoint`, and `PipelineCheckpointUpdates`.
- Added unit tests covering the new pipeline support objects.
- Tests run: `make check` (pytest + coverage, lint, type, security, client build).
- Python file count (src/): 611 → 579 (-32).
- Before→After map:
	- coerce_* / emit_* / no_games_* / checkpoint + timestamp helpers → `app/use_cases/pipeline_support.py` objects.
	- tests/test_small_modules.py no-games checkpoint import → tests/test_pipeline_support.py coverage for new objects.

Session summary (2026-02-04):
- Consolidated Chess.com and Lichess client helpers into infra client adapters.
- Added `ports.GameSourceClient` and updated pipeline typing to use the port interface.
- Updated chess client shims and tests to target the consolidated infra modules.
- Tests run: `make check` (before + after).
- Python file count (src/): 579 → 528 (-51).
- Before→After map:
	- *_chesscom_* helpers (cursor/pagination/rate limit/fixtures/archive) → `infra/clients/chesscom_client.py`.
	- *_lichess_client.py helpers + game_fetching → `infra/clients/lichess_client.py`.
	- pipeline client typing (`BaseChessClient`) → `ports.GameSourceClient`.
