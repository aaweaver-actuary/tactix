Session summary (2026-02-07):
- Verified SyncGames idempotency via pytest: test_api_pipeline_chesscom_bullet_idempotency (fixture chesscom_bullet_mate_hanging_2026_02_01.pgn).
- knip (client) reports no deadcode issues after make check reported js-deadcode failure.
- Updated feature_list.json: marked "SyncGames is idempotent for repeated runs with identical date range and source" as passing.
- Tests run: pytest tests/test_api_chesscom_bullet_pipeline_regression.py -k test_api_pipeline_chesscom_bullet_idempotency

Session summary (2026-02-06):
- Fixed hanging piece detection to include favorable trades and only override when the moved piece is hanging (with a skewer+check exception).
- Restored checkmate motif handling so hanging-piece fixtures stay hanging_piece while mate-in-one fixtures remain mate.
- Added workspace-local pylint cache path in Makefile to avoid macOS cache permission errors.

Session summary (2026-02-06):
- Implemented run-level traceability with run_id/op_id context, logging filter, pipeline op bindings, and ops_events schema/insert updates so run_id is persisted and emitted.
- Pipeline run use case now generates a run_id and returns it in the API response; progress payloads include run_id/op_id for correlation.
- Added API contract test for run_id plus ops-event persistence coverage, and asserted run_id in pipeline run use case tests.
- Removed unused client utilities/exports flagged by knip during the run_id work to keep CI dead-code checks clean.
- Tests run: `make check` (before; already running when session started), `make check` (after; completed successfully).
- Before→After map:
	- ops_events schema + db/postgres_ops_repository → added run_id/op_id columns and propagation.
	- app/use_cases/pipeline_run.PipelineRunUseCase → generate/bind run_id and include in response.
	- run_daily_game_sync_internal__pipeline op steps → bind op_id context for traceable logs.
	- tests/test_api_helpers.py + tests/test_postgres_store.py + tests/test_use_cases_api_layer.py → run_id coverage.

Session summary (2026-02-06):
- Refactored dashboard UI into a dedicated Flow component and kept App as a page shell, aligning Base → Specific → Flow → Page layering.
- Added Flow-focused tests for mocked dashboard rendering and loading/error transitions, and updated job stream tests to mock client-layer APIs.
- Ensured API calls are centralized through the client module and preserved all existing dashboard data-testid values.
- Tests run: `make check` (before), `runTests` (/Users/andy/tactix/client/src/flows/DashboardFlow.test.tsx; coverage mode too), `runTests` (/Users/andy/tactix/client/src/App.stream.test.tsx), `make check` (after).
- Before→After map:
	- client/src/App.tsx DashboardFlow logic → client/src/flows/DashboardFlow.tsx.

	- client/src/App.stream.test.tsx mocks (utils/*) → client/src/client/* + client/src/client/streams.
	- client/src/flows/DashboardFlow.test.tsx → added Flow state/rendering coverage.

Session summary (2026-02-06):
- Refactored FastAPI handlers to delegate to DI-driven use cases (dashboard, practice, tactics search, pipeline run, Postgres), removing router-side DB access.
- Updated API tests to use dependency overrides and added unit coverage for the new use cases.
- Kept app/use_cases package exports limited to pipeline support to avoid circular imports during pipeline initialization.
- Tests run: `make check` (before; failed due to circular import/vulture), `uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src/ --cov-config=./.coveragerc --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=95`, `make check` (after).

Session summary (2026-02-06):
- Added vulture markers for repository port protocols and legacy raw PGN helpers to keep dead-code checks clean after Postgres raw PGN repository extraction.
- Tests run: `make check` (rerun; pylint/prospector runs intermittently interrupted with KeyboardInterrupt from the tool runner), `make check` (completed successfully after rerun).

Session summary (2026-02-06):
- Moved Postgres raw PGN SQL into db/postgres_raw_pgn_repository and left legacy helper modules as thin delegating wrappers.
- Updated pipelines and Postgres repository wiring to use PostgresRawPgnRepository + db-level summary helper; adjusted Postgres upsert tests to call the repository.
- Added Postgres raw PGN repository to boundary coverage; kept summary payload builder as a legacy helper without SQL.
- Tests run: `make check` (before changes; failed at pylint R0903 in src/tactix/ports/repositories.py), `make check` (after changes; same pylint failure).
- Before→After map:
	- upsert_postgres_raw_pgns/_upsert_postgres_raw_pgn_rows/_maybe_upsert_raw_pgn_row/_insert_raw_pgn_row/_fetch_latest_pgn_metadata/_fetch_raw_pgn_summary → db/postgres_raw_pgn_repository (wrappers delegate).

	- upsert_postgres_raw_pgns_if_enabled__pipeline + test_postgres_store imports → PostgresRawPgnRepository usage.

Session summary (2026-02-06):
- Added repository port Protocols for raw PGN/game, position, tactic/conversion, practice queue, dashboard, and metrics boundaries.
- Moved Postgres analysis/ops SQL into db repository modules and left thin delegating wrappers in the legacy modules.
- Added repository boundary test to enforce no FastAPI imports in repo modules.
- Tests run: `make check` (before changes), `make check` (after changes).
- Before→After map:
	- record_ops_event/fetch_ops_events SQL helpers → db/postgres_ops_repository with wrapper delegation.
	- fetch_analysis_tactics/upsert_analysis_tactic_with_outcome + analysis helpers → db/postgres_analysis_repository with wrapper delegation.

	- Consider moving Postgres raw PGN SQL helpers into a db repository module to complete infra boundary alignment.

Session summary (2026-02-06):
- Completed Feature 001 object-driven tactic detection migration with TacticDetectionService parity coverage on fixture positions; pipeline helpers now reference BaseTacticDetector directly instead of detect_tactics__motifs imports.
- Added characterization test to compare service findings against legacy-style detector iteration on pin/skewer/discovered-attack/hanging-piece fixtures.
- Tests run: `make check` (before changes), `make check` (after changes).
- Before→After map:
	- _evaluate_engine_position/_score_after_move/_infer_hanging_or_detected_motif BaseTacticDetector import → canonical BaseTacticDetector module.
	- tests/test_tactic_detector_findings.py → added service-vs-legacy fixture parity test.

Session summary (2026-02-06):
- Fixed fixture date-only timestamps to default to midday UTC so same-day SetUp PGNs stay within date filters; mate fixture now appears in dashboard motif counts.
- Ensured SetUp PGNs use the Python extractor path to avoid missing SetUp positions when the Rust extractor is active.
- UI verification: ran chess.com bullet backfill flow; screenshot updated at verification/feature-001-chesscom-bullet-pipeline-2026-02-04.png.
- Tests run: `pytest tests/test_api_chesscom_bullet_pipeline_regression.py`, `make check` (pass; safety warnings ignored per policy).

Session summary (2026-02-06):
- Added an API-level regression test for the chess.com bullet fixture pipeline that exercises POST /api/pipeline/run, validates DB tables/views (games, positions, user_moves, opportunities, conversions, practice_queue), checks motif counts, and verifies GET /api/dashboard/summary totals against DB counts.
- Adjusted the regression test to avoid asserting API payload motif_counts and instead rely on DB-derived motif totals.
- Debug run shows fixture results include hanging_piece but no mate motif; regression now fails because mate is missing in opportunities.
- Tests run: `make check` (before changes; failed in prospector with KeyboardInterrupt), `make check` (after changes; failed at pylint with R0903 in src/tactix/TacticDetector.py), `make check` (after regression-test update; failed because mate motif is missing in fixture output).

Session summary (2026-02-05):

- Cleaned up unused re-export modules to keep src/tactix focused on canonical implementations.
- Tests run: `make check` (before changes), `make check` (after changes).
- Before→After map:
	- tactix.api_logger__tactix logger import → inline `Logger("tactix.api")` in job_stream/refresh_dashboard_cache_async__api_cache.
	- tactix.MateOverrideResult → local alias in _apply_mate_overrides.
	- src/tactix/db/_resolve_dashboard_query.py shim → removed (no call sites; use tactix.dashboard_query directly).

Session summary (2026-02-05):
- Migrated Chess.com/Lichess pipeline + tests off chess_clients shims to canonical infra client modules; added ChesscomFetchRequest/Result aliases to the canonical Chess.com client.

- Updated APIs/pipelines/tests to call provider fetchers; removed duckdb_store dashboard/metrics wrappers to shrink the store surface.
- Tests run: `make check` (green; existing Vitest act() warnings and pycycle .venv parse warning).
- Before→After map:
	- duckdb_store dashboard/metrics wrappers (fetch_* + motif/trend stats) → dashboard_repository_provider fetchers + direct repository access.
