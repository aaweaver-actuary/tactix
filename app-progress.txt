- Tests run: `make check` (before + after).
- Before→After map:
	- tactix.PostgresStore/PostgresStatus/ProgressCallback/TacticsSearchFilters imports → tactix.postgres_store_impl, tactix.postgres_status, tactix.pipeline_state__pipeline, tactix.tactics_search_filters.
	- Shim modules (dashboard.py, DashboardQueryFilters.py, TacticsSearchFilters.py, PostgresStore.py, PostgresStatus.py, ProgressCallback.py) → review-for-deletion/ copies.

Session summary (2026-02-04):
- Audited legacy job stream module references after consolidation.
- Confirmed remaining job streaming references are all in `job_stream.py` and test coverage only.
- Tests run: `make check` (before + after).
- Before→After map:
	- Legacy job stream imports/usages → verified none outside `job_stream.py` and tests; no legacy modules left in src/tactix.

Session summary (2026-02-04):
- Refactored duplicated BackfillWindow accessors into a shared mixin for job-stream contexts.
- Tests run: `make check` (before + after).

- Added regression tests for small modules and rating bucket SQL clauses.
- Cleaned lint/type/vulture issues introduced during refactors.
- Ran make check (pytest, vitest, xenon, pycycle, safety, bandit, dodgy, jscpd, vulture, knip, cargo build, client build).

Session summary (2026-02-04):
- Fixed lint failures (E501, PLR0913) in PGN upsert helpers with small refactors.

Session summary (2026-02-04):
- Refactored duplicated analysis context accessors into `_AnalysisRunAccessors`.
- Refactored no-games context initialization and window accessors into shared helpers/mixin.
- Before→After map:
	- AnalysisRunContext/AnalysisAndMetricsContext properties → `_AnalysisRunAccessors` mixin.
	- NoGames* context window/games validation + accessors → `_resolve_no_games_window_from_kwargs`, `_require_no_games_payload_games`, `_NoGamesWindowAccessors`.

Session summary (2026-02-04):
- Consolidated 33 pipeline helper modules into `app/use_cases/pipeline_support.py` with object-backed helpers.
- Migrated pipeline call sites to `PipelineCoercions`, `PipelineProfileFilters`, `PipelineEmissions`, `PipelineNoGames`, `PipelineAnalysisCheckpoint`, and `PipelineCheckpointUpdates`.
- Added unit tests covering the new pipeline support objects.
- Tests run: `make check` (pytest + coverage, lint, type, security, client build).
- Python file count (src/): 611 → 579 (-32).
- Before→After map:
	- coerce_* / emit_* / no_games_* / checkpoint + timestamp helpers → `app/use_cases/pipeline_support.py` objects.
	- tests/test_small_modules.py no-games checkpoint import → tests/test_pipeline_support.py coverage for new objects.

Session summary (2026-02-04):
