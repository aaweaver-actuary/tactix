- Hid the practice modal best-move badge until after an attempt; added best-move test id for automation and updated practice attempt script to avoid pre-attempt best lookup.
- Manual verification: node verification/puppeteer_feature_practice_best_move_hidden.js (feature-practice-best-move-hidden-before-2026-02-10.png, feature-practice-best-move-hidden-after-2026-02-10.png).
- Integration verification: node verification/integration_feature_practice_best_move_hidden.js.
- Tests run: make check (initially failed js-deadcode, fixed and reran).
