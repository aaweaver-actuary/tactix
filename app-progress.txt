Session summary (initializer)
- Generated feature_list.json with 400 unique tests (30 have >=10 steps; categories functional+style; all passes=false).
- Added init.sh to install dependencies via uv/npm, optional Airflow bootstrap, optional dev server startup.
- Updated README with project overview, stack, and quick start instructions.
- No code implementation yet; Python deps not added beyond pyproject template.
- Next: add actual backend/frontend code, populate pyproject dependencies with uv add, wire Rust extractor, and begin marking tests as they pass.

Session 2026-01-24 (backend + UI scaffold)
- Targeted feature 001: added backend pipeline skeleton (config, DuckDB schema, Lichess fetcher, PGN position extractor, Stockfish wrapper with deterministic options, tactics analyzer, pipeline runner, FastAPI API, Airflow DAG stub).
- Scaffolded React/Vite/Tailwind dashboard with cache-busting indicator and buttons to trigger sync via API.
- Updated pyproject for Python 3.12 stack and added Airflow/analytics dependencies; Python 3.12 not yet installed locally, uv sync pending.
- Outstanding: install Python 3.12 + recreate venv, run uv sync, wire real Stockfish 17 binary with checksum, add robust motif detection and tests (unit/integration/puppeteer), run Airflow DAG end-to-end, capture screenshots, and flip feature 001 after verification.

Session 2026-01-24 (feature 001 end-to-end verification)
- Installed Python 3.12 venv, synced dependencies, and ran full pytest suite (11 passing) covering checkpoints, extractor, Stockfish determinism, Airflow DAG load, and pipeline/metrics writing.
- Reset checkpoint and ran `run_daily_game_sync` using fixture PGNs; DuckDB now holds raw_pgns=2, positions=48, tactics=48, outcomes=48 with metrics_version=10.
- Defaulted Stockfish config to PATH (`stockfish`) while allowing env override; analysis still deterministic.
- Rebuilt frontend with `VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000`, axios honors env base, and Puppeteer script now starts/stops FastAPI + preview automatically; captured dashboard screenshot at `verification/feature001-dashboard.png`.
- Feature 001 verified through UI (pipeline trigger, metrics refresh, dashboard data), passes=true in feature_list.json.
