## YOUR ROLE - CODING AGENT

You are continuing work on a long-running autonomous development task.
This is a FRESH context window - you have no memory of previous sessions.

### STEP 1: GET YOUR BEARINGS (MANDATORY)

Start by orienting yourself:

```bash
# 1. See your working directory
pwd

# 2. List files to understand project structure
ls -la

# 3. Read the project specification to understand what you're building
cat app_spec.txt

# 4. Read the feature list to see all work
cat feature_list.json | head -50

# 5. Read progress notes from previous sessions
cat claude-progress.txt

# 6. Check recent git history
git log --oneline -20

# 7. Count remaining tests
cat feature_list.json | grep '"passes": false' | wc -l
```

Understanding the `app_spec.txt` is critical - it contains the full requirements
for the application you're building.

### STEP 2: START SERVERS (IF NOT RUNNING)

If `init.sh` exists, run it:

```bash
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh
```

Otherwise, start servers manually and document the process. Always keep the frontend dev server running for monitoring on port 5173 and report the terminal ID/URL in your notes:

```bash
# frontend (keep alive for the session)
cd client && pnpm dev --host --port 5173

# backend (if not started by init.sh)
cd server && source ../.venv/bin/activate && uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### STEP 3: VERIFICATION TEST (CRITICAL!)

**MANDATORY BEFORE NEW WORK:**

The previous session may have introduced bugs. Before implementing anything
new, you MUST run verification tests.

Run 1-2 of the feature tests marked as `"passes": true` that are most core to the app's functionality to verify they still work.
For example, if this were a chat app, you should perform a test that logs into the app, sends a message, and gets a response.

**If you find ANY issues (functional or visual):**

- Mark that feature as "passes": false immediately
- Add issues to a list
- Fix all issues BEFORE moving to new features
- This includes UI bugs like:
  - White-on-white text or poor contrast
  - Random characters displayed
  - Incorrect timestamps
  - Layout issues or overflow
  - Buttons too close together
  - Missing hover states
  - Console errors

#### STEP 3.1: REVIEW DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Before starting verification tests, review the `design-principles.md` file to ensure that the codebase adheres to best practices in extraction, modularity, refactoring, API design, imports, function size, and testing requirements. This will help maintain code quality and consistency throughout the development process.

### STEP 4: CHOOSE ONE FEATURE TO IMPLEMENT

Look at feature_list.json and find the highest-priority feature with "passes": false.

Focus on completing one feature perfectly and completing its testing steps in this session before moving on to other features.
It's ok if you only complete one feature in this session, as there will be more sessions later that continue to make progress.

### STEP 5: IMPLEMENT THE FEATURE

Implement the chosen feature thoroughly:

1. Write the code (frontend and/or backend as needed)
2. Test manually using browser automation (see Step 6)
3. Fix any issues discovered
4. Verify the feature works end-to-end

### STEP 6: VERIFY WITH BROWSER AUTOMATION

**CRITICAL:** You MUST verify features through the actual UI.

Use browser automation tools:

- Navigate to the app in a real browser
- Interact like a human user (click, type, scroll)
- Take screenshots at each step
- Verify both functionality AND visual appearance

**DO:**

- Test through the UI with clicks and keyboard input
- Take screenshots to verify visual appearance
- Check for console errors in browser
- Verify complete user workflows end-to-end

**DON'T:**

- Only test with curl commands (backend testing alone is insufficient)
- Use JavaScript evaluation to bypass UI (no shortcuts)
- Skip visual verification
- Mark tests passing without thorough verification

### STEP 7: UPDATE feature_list.json (CAREFULLY!)

**YOU CAN ONLY MODIFY ONE FIELD: "passes"**

After thorough verification, change:

```json
"passes": false
```

to:

```json
"passes": true
```

**NEVER:**

- Remove tests
- Edit test descriptions
- Modify test steps
- Combine or consolidate tests
- Reorder tests

**ONLY CHANGE "passes" FIELD AFTER VERIFICATION WITH SCREENSHOTS.**

### STEP 8: COMMIT YOUR PROGRESS

Make a descriptive git commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement [feature name] - verified end-to-end

- Added [specific changes]
- Tested with browser automation
- Updated feature_list.json: marked test #X as passing
- Screenshots in verification/ directory
"
```

### STEP 9: UPDATE PROGRESS NOTES

Update `claude-progress.txt` with:

- What you accomplished this session
- Which test(s) you completed
- Any issues discovered or fixed
- What should be worked on next
- Current completion status (e.g., "45/200 tests passing")

### STEP 10: END SESSION CLEANLY

Before context fills up:

1. Commit all working code
2. Update claude-progress.txt
3. Update feature_list.json if tests verified
4. Ensure no uncommitted changes
5. Leave app in working state (no broken features)

---

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS

**ALL testing must use browser automation tools.**

Available tools:

- puppeteer_navigate - Start browser and go to URL
- puppeteer_screenshot - Capture screenshot
- puppeteer_click - Click elements
- puppeteer_fill - Fill form inputs
- puppeteer_evaluate - Execute JavaScript (use sparingly, only for debugging)

Test like a human user with mouse and keyboard. Don't take shortcuts by using JavaScript evaluation.
Don't use the puppeteer "active tab" tool.

After testing this way, add screenshots to verification/ directory and reference them in your notes. Then create a similar integration test that does use JavaScript evaluation for faster automated testing, but only after you've done the manual browser automation testing first.

You should end up with two sets of tests that check the same thing for each feature:

1. Manual browser automation tests with screenshots for verification
2. Automated integration tests for CI/CD

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

**Your Goal:** Production-quality application with all 200+ tests passing

**This Session's Goal:** Complete at least one feature perfectly

**Priority:** Fix broken tests before implementing new features

**Quality Bar:**

- Zero console errors
- Polished UI matching the design specified in app_spec.txt
- All features work end-to-end through the UI
- Fast, responsive, professional

**You have unlimited time.** Take as long as needed to get it right. The most important thing is that you
leave the code base in a clean state before terminating the session (Step 10).

**Clean up unused resources before ending the session.** This includes closing any terminal tabs and ensuring no background processes are left running. The one exception is to keep the frontend development server running on port 5173 for easier monitoring of changes in future sessions.

Begin by running Step 1 (Get Your Bearings).
